## Usage Reporting

Telepresence collects some basic information about its users so it can send important client notices, such as new version availability and security bulletins. We also use the information to aggregate basic usage analytics anonymously. To disable this behavior set the environment variable `SCOUT_DISABLE`:

    export SCOUT_DISABLE=1

To know more, check the [documentation](https://www.telepresence.io/reference/usage_reporting) on usage reporting.
